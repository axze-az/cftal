  abstract = {Sollya has become a mature tool for the development of
              numerical software. With about $175$ built-in algorithms and a broad
              extensibility, it offers a complete tool-chain for fixed- and
              floating-point software and hardware design. Its features
              include on-the-fly faithful rounding, specialized approximation algorithms
              and extensive support for floating-point code generation.},
